          In this visualization, we explore the relationship of movies through time. By considering popularity and a subset of movie features, we learn more about what makes a movie successful and how our taste might change through time. As we travel through each decade, play close attention to which movies are considered similar to each other, the top three keywords describing the movies for that decade, and the way the clusters of data form. Enjoy the show!

          Let’s orient you to the visualization. The current years of movies you are looking at appears right above this narration (a ‘bin’). As you scroll the page, the bin will change and we’ll talk a little bit about what’s going on right here. You can monitor your progress through the current bin with the progress bar at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the far right is a running list of top keywords movies had within the bins up to and including the currently viewed one - this can help you get a sense of how themes change with time. If you wish to quickly advance, there’s also some convenience buttons at the bottom. Finally, use the search box to help you find specific keywords, studios, movies, directors, or actors on the soon-to-be-displayed chart.

          This is a t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) cluster chart. t-SNE is an algorithm used for dimensionality reduction of high-dimension data into two or three dimensions. These reduced dimensions can then be plotted in a scatterplot space, where similar points are near one another and dissimilar points are apart. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Each movie's data (features) was built from the Director, Title, Runtime, Genre, Top 3 Lead Actors, Production Studio, and the presence of the top keywords for the bin. These features were then run through a two-dimensional t-SNE, reducing them down to single pairs of coordinates. By hovering over a movie, you'll be able to view these features. What patterns and similarities can you find within this scatter?

          Cinematography predates or is omitted from even the vast collection of films shown here. For example, "The Horse in Motion" is an example of 1878 motion photography,created by taking a series of simultaneous pictures. "Roundhay Garden Scene" was then created in 1888 - a 2.1 seconds long movie. A final that made it into this visualiztion is "Arrival of a Train" in 1895, a short of a train being pulled into a station.
        </p>

          Finding specific movies can be hard. In this case we've pointed to a specific movie for you, but if you'd like, try searching for movies using the search box in the bottom right. You can search by any of the names, studios, or keywords found in the movies - for example, try finding movies from "Disney" (pressing 'Enter' to submit your query). To clear your search, simply clear the search box of text and press 'Enter'.

          In the beginning movies were only black and white and primarily silent films. Before there was sound in films musicians sat below the screen and would play music along with the movie. The first move with sound was the The Jazz Singer made in 1927. While some movies before 1950 had sound it was not popular until the 50s. Search “silent film” while in this decade and then again when you move onto the 50s and see how movies changed.

          Coloring t-SNE charts can be done in a variety of ways, the method choosen for this visualization being particularly interesting. While a 2 Dimensional t-SNE was used to plot the individual movies, a seperate 3 Dimensional t-SNE was ran to color them. Each coordinate in the 3D space was translated to an RGB Triplet (as in, X-Coordinates determine 'redness', Y-Coordinates 'greenness', and Z-Coordintes 'blueness'. Points of similar locality and colors, then, would share a similarity in a three dimensional space.

          World War II ended September 2, 1945. The war had a big impact on entertainment at that time, most films, radio stations, news paper articles were written realistically instead of for entertainment. During the war the only way most people could get information was by going to the cinemas to see educational films. Most of these films served to educate people on their countries war efforts and progress of the war. As you can see there are many movies that are based on World War II in the 50s.

        The 50s is often described using the word BOOM the economy boomed, it was the year of the Baby Boom, and cinema attendance Boomed all due to the end of WWII. The 50s films were greatly impacted by WWI, films were idealized with portrayals of the war and groups of people rebelling or going against authority. If you search ‘World War’ you will find all the movies made in the 50s about the war.

          It's important to note the distance between any two points in t-SNE is virtually meaningless. A point an inch away from another means nothing more than one six inches away. What's important are that points can be close together, or they can be far apart, representing whether or not they are similar. Nothing more can be said about their spatial position.

          As for the 1970's - well that's Spaghetti Western, at least according to the most popularly weighted keyterm for the decade. Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western, are a variety of the Western genre that emerged in the mid-1960's due to Sergio Leone's success in the film industry.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="statement">
        <p>
          Notice the size of the bubbles for movies containing "Spaghetti Western", however. Bubble size correlates to the popularity of a movie - that is it's rating multiplied by the number of ratings it recieved. This might be attributed to the fact these movies tended to have a style that allowed for low budgets in Europe and American genres were rapidly changing. The classic Western started evolving from here until a rougher form was made, with some critics believing Sergio Leone influenced it.

          By now, perhaps, you've begun to notice other bubbles border changes when hovering on a movie. That's because those bubbles were found to be clustered together by kMeans clustering. t-SNE, while a clustering algorithm, has the limitation that it only visually clusters data - it does not explicitly define one bubble as being part of a cluster relative to another. Thus, to help aid in finding individual clusters, we ran a 20 kMeans clustering on the 2D t-SNE - identifying 20 clusters of movies somewhat close to one another in space.

          It is interesting to look at how t-SNE decides these movies are clustered together. Look at the highlighted cluster and see if you can notice a pattern? All of the movies that were clustered together happen to have a keyword or their title is about traveling or a location, some of the key words in this cluster include Cuba, Sea, and Space. Most of the movies in this cluster have other similarities as well, like a high rating or genre.

         You may start to notice that there is more variety in moves in this decade compaird to the last. Movies in the 70s started to diverge for the previous decades themes of noir and western, these new movies were all unique and creative. This divergence of movies can be attributed most to the new music being released and the hight of war and crime in the 70s. Different directors started to emerge (ex. Steven Spielberg) and began producing movies that were new and futuristic. The crime-drama genre was created and multitude of movies about crime and technology were released (ex. Star Wars and The Godfather).

          By time it was the 80’s the Soviets and America had been rivals for more than 30 years and relations between the two superpowers continued to deteriorate. While the war was still ramping up the so were the movies, the 80s were said to be the decade that introduced the idea of ‘high-concept’ films. The Cold War had a huge impact on movies in the 80’s causing may movies to revolve around the troubles and attitudes face while being at war.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="statement">
        <p>
          One of the main themes that can be tied to the Cold War are those movies involving outer space, like E.T and Star War. As the United States and Soviet Union were still in the Space Race at the time, movies involving space became extremely popular as you can see by the amout of movies highlighted. The Cold War can also be attributed to other big name movies made in the 80s such as Rocky IV which mirrors the conflict between the Soviet Union and United States by having an American boxer (Rocky) fight a Soviet boxer (Drago).

          The 80s were also known for ramping up the quality of movies. Film budgets skyrocketed, movie concepts became more complex and the term ‘blockbuster’ was introduced. With Hollywood's search for a ‘blockbuster’ movie that they thought everyone needed to see producers, studios and directors started to improve the quality of their movies. Some of these ‘blockbuster’ movies that were produced in the 80s are Raiders of the Lost Arc, Ghostbusters and Back to the Future, see if you can find some other blockbuster movies in the mix.

         The 90s in cinema history is known as the decade of money, mega-spending, and special effects. While the 80s had begun to ramp up how movies were made the 90s took it even further. Ticket prices for movies when up, actors started getting payed more and movies were being sold more. ’Big hit’ movies increased and digital effects were pushed in this decade and sometimes storylines suffered due to the need for exciting looking movies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="statement">
       <p>
        As explained before the size of the movie bubble is affected by the rating of the movie. Before the 90s most movies were mainly watched in the theaters, with very few homes having a VCR. In the 90s DVDs and home viewing had emerged helping to boost movie sales and ratings. Look at the movies that are in the highlighted areas, these are the highest rated movies in the 90s. Most of you probably remember having these movies on DVD and remember watching movies like Forrest Gump or the Titanic at home on the couch.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="statement">
       <p>
        Because movies were now being sold and watched more the budgets for movies began to go up. CGI was becoming a big part of movies and actors were growing in popularity. Actors were beginning to get paid more, they were asking to change parts of the movies, and where their names would appear on the credits. Some of the highest paid stars of the 90s were: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Robin Williams, Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis and many more. Many of these actors are still superstars today such as Winona Ryder, who is now one of the main characters in the hit netflix show Stranger things. See if you can find movies that include popular actors that are not listed in this narrative? (hint there are at least 40 more)

          In the 2000's, one of the most influencial series of this generation was introduced as a movie. "Harry Potter" is a series of fantasy novels written by J.K. Rowling published in 1997. Warner Bro's produced the first Harry Potter movie, "Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone" in November 2001.

          As you can see that four of the Harry Potter movies are clusterd together: "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "The Prisioner of Azkaban,"
          "The Chamber of Secrets," and "The Goblet of Fire." Two of the other movies in the series, "The Half-Blood Prince" and "The Order of the Phoenix", however, are clustered together elsewhere in space - perhaps more akin to others than their predecessors. Why might this be?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="statement">
        <p>
          This powerful series has not only created an escape to a magical world, but spawned a movement filled with fans. The success of the novels has led to the creation of "Pottermore" - a website dedicated to brining fans beyond the story of the books, engrossing users in the world of wizardry.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we've highlighted one blockbuster series, what other series can you find and what are their relations to Harry Potter? How might this have compared to the Spaghetti Western's of the past? Hint: We've pointed to one to help you get started.

          Starting their rise to top of the decade in the late 2000s, super-human cinematography has taken the spotlight of the 2010 decade. With the introduction of cutting-edge special effects pulling viewers from reality, superhero based films have taken their comic-based inspiration to the big screen for the public. With their jaw-dropping cinematography and massive comic backing, its no surprise these film have become increasingly popular.

          Cinema spectacles may not be the only reason for their dramatic climb to popularity, however. With dark events crowding recent history - be it the events of 9/11, the Housing Market Crash, or inclement weather catastrophes - perhaps more are looking towards the cinema to provide the hero they need. Although their popularity started beforehand, the reality of events such as these could have pushed more and more for that sense of comfort and thrill a superhero can bring.

          With growing power of computing technology, the cinema has seen the boundaries of our world pushed more and more. The decade has brought hits such as "Gravity", "Mad Max: Fury Road", and more. As computers help us push the boundaries of excitement and realism, creating a more believable and immersive environment, the cinema has seen greater creativity than every before. The technological growth has certainly been exponential, leaving us - the viewers - on the edge of our seats for what cinema has to offer next.
