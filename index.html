          In this visualization, we explore the ties of time with movie popularity and characteristics to find a relationship
          between what makes a movie successful, and how our taste changes through time can influence the movies that are considered well-done. 
          As we travel through each decade, play close attention to which movies are considered similar to each other, the top
          three keywords for each decade, the top rated movies, and the way the clusters of data form. 
          Enjoy the show!

          Let’s orient you to the visualization. The current years of movies you are looking at appears right above this narration (a ‘bin’). As you scroll the page, the bin will change and we’ll talk a little bit about what’s going on right here. You can monitor your progress through the current bin with the progress bar at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the far right is a running list of top keywords movies had within the bins up to and including the currently viewed one - this can help you get a sense of how themes change with time. If you wish to quickly advance, there’s also some convenience buttons at the bottom. Finally, use the search box to help you find specific keywords, studios, movies, directors, or actors on the soon-to-be-displayed chart.

          This is a t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) cluster chart. t-SNE is an algorithm used for dimensionality reduction of high-dimension data into two or three dimensions. These reduced dimensions can then be plotted in a scatterplot space, where similar points are near one another and dissimilar points are apart. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Each movie's data (features) was built from the Director, Title, Runtime, Genre, Top 3 Lead Actors, Production Studio, and the presence of the top keywords for the bin. These features were then run through a two-dimensional t-SNE, reducing them down to single pairs of coordinates. By hovering over a movie, you'll be able to view these features. What patterns and similarities can you find within this scatter?

          Cinematography predates or is omitted from even the vast collection of films shown here. For example, "The Horse in Motion" is an example of 1878 motion photography,created by taking a series of simultaneous pictures. "Roundhay Garden Scene" was then created in 1888 - a 2.1 seconds long movie. A final that made it into this visualiztion is "Arrival of a Train" in 1895, a short of a train being pulled into a station.

          Finding specific movies can be hard. In this case we've pointed to a specific movie for you, but if you'd like, try searching for movies using the search box in the bottom right. You can search by any of the names, studios, or keywords found in the movies - for example, try finding movies from "Disney" (pressing 'Enter' to submit your query). To clear your search, simply clear the search box of text and press 'Enter'.

          In the beginning movies were only black and white and primarily silent films. Before there was sound in films musicians sat below the screen and would play music along with the movie. The first move with sound was the The Jazz Singer made in 1927. While some movies before 1950 had sound it was not popular until the 50s. Search “silent film” while in this decade and then again when you move onto the 50s and see how movies changed.

          Coloring t-SNE charts can be done in a variety of ways, the method choosen for this visualization being particularly interesting. While a 2 Dimensional t-SNE was used to plot the individual movies, a seperate 3 Dimensional t-SNE was ran to color them. Each coordinate in the 3D space was translated to an RGB Triplet (as in, X-Coordinates determine 'redness', Y-Coordinates 'greenness', and Z-Coordintes 'blueness'. Points of similar locality and colors, then, would share a similarity in a three dimensional space.

          It's important to note the distance between any two points in t-SNE is virtually meaningless. A point an inch away from another means nothing more than one six inches away. What's important are that points can be close together, or they can be far apart, representing whether or not they are similar. Nothing more can be said about their spatial position.

          As for the 1970's - well that's Spaghetti Western, at least according to the most popularly weighted keyterm for the decade. Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western, are a variety of the Western genre that emerged in the mid-1960's due to Sergio Leone's success in the film industry.

          <!-- This is Statement #9 -->
          Notice the size of the bubbles for movies containing "Spaghetti Western", however. Bubble size correlates to the popularity of a movie - that is it's rating multiplied by the number of ratings it recieved. This might be attributed to the fact these movies tended to have a style that allowed for low budgets in Europe and American genres were rapidly changing. The classic Western started evolving from here until a rougher form was made, with some critics believing Sergio Leone influenced it.

      </div>
      <div class="statement" id="graph1980">
        <p>
          By now, perhaps, you've begun to notice other bubbles border changes when hovering on a movie. That's because those bubbles were found to be clustered together by kMeans clustering. t-SNE, while a clustering algorithm, has the limitation that it only visually clusters data - it does not explicitly define one bubble as being part of a cluster relative to another. Thus, to help aid in finding individual clusters, we ran a 20 kMeans clustering on the 2D t-SNE - identifying 20 clusters of movies somewhat close to one another in space.

          In the 2000's, one of the most influencial series of this generation was introduced as a movie. "Harry Potter" is a series of fantasy novels written by J.K. Rowling published in 1997. Warner Bro's produced the first Harry Potter movie, "Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone" in November 2001.

          As you can see that four of the Harry Potter movies are clusterd together: "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "The Prisioner of Azkaban,"
          "The Chamber of Secrets," and "The Goblet of Fire." Two of the other movies in the series, "The Half-Blood Prince" and "The Order of the Phoenix", however, are clustered together elsewhere in space - perhaps more akin to others than their predecessors. Why might this be?

      <div class="statement">
        <p>
          This powerful series has not only created an escape to a magical world, but spawned a movement filled with fans. The success of the novels has led to the creation of "Pottermore" - a website dedicated to brining fans beyond the story of the books, engrossing users in the world of wizardry.

          Starting their rise to top of the decade in the late 2000s, super-human cinematography has taken the spotlight of the 2010 decade. With the introduction of cutting-edge special effects pulling viewers from reality, superhero based films have taken their comic-based inspiration to the big screen for the public. With their jaw-dropping cinematography and massive comic backing, its no surprise these film have become increasingly popular.

          Cinema spectacles may not be the only reason for their dramatic climb to popularity, however. With dark events crowding recent history - be it the events of 9/11, the Housing Market Crash, or inclement weather catastrophes - perhaps more are looking towards the cinema to provide the hero they need. Although their popularity started beforehand, the reality of events such as these could have pushed more and more for that sense of comfort and thrill a superhero can bring.

          With growing power of computing technology, the cinema has seen the boundaries of our world pushed more and more. The decade has brought hits such as "Gravity", "Mad Max: Fury Road", and more. As computers help us push the boundaries of excitement and realism, creating a more believable and immersive environment, the cinema has seen greater creativity than every before. The technological growth has certainly been exponential, leaving us - the viewers - on the edge of our seats for what cinema has to offer next.
